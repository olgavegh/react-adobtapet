# 🐶 Adopt a Pet!

This is a small React project to practice using **React Router v6**.

## 📚 What I’ll Learn

- Setting up routing in React with React Router
- Using `<Route>`, `<Link>`, `<Navigate>`, and `useNavigate`
- Reading route parameters with `useParams`
- Working with query parameters
- Creating nested routes
- Handling “not found” pages

## 🚀 Features

- Home page shows all pets
- Filter pets by species using the URL
- View pet details by ID (e.g. `/pets/123`)
- Search pets by name using query parameters (e.g. `/search?name=bella`)
- Show a PetNotFound page if a pet is not found
- “Go Home” button returns to the main page

## 🗂️ Key Files

- `App.js` – sets up routing
- `src/pages/home` – main list of pets
- `src/pages/detail` – pet details page
- `src/pages/search` – search results
- `src/pages/petNotFound` – not found page
